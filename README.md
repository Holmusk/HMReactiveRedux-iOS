# HMReactiveRedux-iOS
Rx-enabled Redux implementation for iOS clients.

Simply subscribe to state streams HMReduxStore<HMState> (or its typealias, HMStateStore) to receive notifications whenever state changes.
Enums with parameters should be used in place of action creators, as demonstrated in the sample app.
